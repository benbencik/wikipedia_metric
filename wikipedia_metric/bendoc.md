# Wikipedia metric

The idea of the project is to somehow search the wikipedia and compare distance of two arbitrary articles. The distance is defined as the number of links between the articles. I was interested to see what I could learn about the data and see which approaches work best.

What I want to do:

- program search of wikipedia
- try if clusteriung works and could help with the search
- analyze and identify the most commonly traversed paths between articles
- identify potential knowledge gaps or areas where information is lacking. Look for isolated clusters or articles with few connections

Limitations:
dumb links
